Overview:-
This document describes a semantic search pipeline designed to retrieve contextually relevant information from a dataset using vector embeddings and a large language model (LLM). The pipeline processes user queries and data chunks to find the best matches based on similarity search, enhancing the relevance of the generated responses.

Workflow

Data Collection and Chunking (Step 1):

Sources: The data can include eBooks, websites, or other documents.

Processing: The collected data is chunked into smaller, manageable pieces for further processing.

Data Embedding (Step 2):

Each chunk of data is converted into a numerical vector representation using an embedding model.

These embeddings are stored for similarity comparison.

Query Embedding (Step 4-5):

When a user submits a query, it is converted into a vector representation using the same embedding model.

Similarity Search (Step 6):

The query vector is compared against the stored data chunk vectors to find the most similar ones.

A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) search retrieves the top-matching vectors.

Context Preparation (Step 7):

The metadata and content of the top-matching chunks are combined with the user query to form a context-rich prompt.

Query Resolution (Step 10):

The prompt is sent to a large language model (LLM), which processes it and generates a response.

Solution Delivery:

The response from the LLM is returned to the user as the solution to the query.
